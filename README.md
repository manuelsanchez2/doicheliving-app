## Doiche Living App

**Doiche Living is a travel blog created in 2019 by a group of friends who have two things in common: travel and Germany**.

In an attempt to raise awareness on the beauty of the country, the blog provides Spanish speakers meaningful information on destinations, routes, where to stay, where to eat, must-sees, etc.

The App will make everything even easier than the [site version](https://www.doicheliving.com/) for the user.
