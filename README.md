**Doiche Living is a travel blog created in 2019 by a group of people who have two things in common: travel and Germany**.

In an attempt to raise awareness on the beauty of the country, the blog provides Spanish speakers meaningful information on destinations, routes, where to stay, where to eat, must-sees, etc.

## VERSION 1.0 || 05.10.2020

‚úîÔ∏è 5 articles on how to organize your trip to Germany \
‚úîÔ∏è 4 articles on the main routes around the country \
‚úîÔ∏è Destinations Hamburg, Berlin, Munich, Frankfurt and Cologne ready to be discovered \
